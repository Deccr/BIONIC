# Bionic - The only chat app you'll ever need.
Chat app built on the MERN stack, just putting up the backend for now, cause im too lazy to do the front end, this will be removed from github at some point, either to re-do the repository, completely change the file structure, do the backend stuff, make this readme look nice, i honestly dont know, but whatever ends up happening, it'll be back up at some point

> Sensitive files are NOT Included, because well, they're sensitive, if you want to get this up and running for yourself, we used parts of travesy media's devconnector backend, so use his frontend to get this working, and even just use his work to get it going, its quite similar

* [Travesy Media's code.](https://github.com/bradtraversy/devconnector_2.0)
   * Note: Not all code is similar.

## Built with 

* [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) - Database for users.
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Web Framework
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - USED TO BUILD GUI
  * This will be used in the future, when we, actually build the UI :)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) - Javascript Runtime Environment

## Who made this?

* [Me/Deccr](https://github.com/deccr/)
* [Joeyscript](https://github.com/joey227/)
